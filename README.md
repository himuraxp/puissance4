# Puissance4

Welcome to Power4, a classic strategy mini-game where two players compete to line up 4 pieces of their colour horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

This project was coded in Angular 15, a popular JavaScript framework for developing interactive web applications.

We hope this game will provide you with hours of entertainment and strategic challenges, while learning new Angular skills.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
